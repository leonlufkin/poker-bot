Creating a CFR Poker Bot to win some $$

## Strategy:
1. Create a custom poker environment (or maybe find another one on GitHub)
2. Learn about counterfactual regret minimization (CFR)
3. Create a bot based that uses CFR to play poker
4. Test with heads-up poker (where CFR achieves Nash equilibrium)
5. Test with full-table poker, and modify accordingly
